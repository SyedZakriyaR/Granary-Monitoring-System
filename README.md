Onions, esteemed in the vibrant tapestry of Indian cuisine, play a pivotal role as they weave their way into innumerable dishes, embodying the culinary essence of the nation. While flourishing primarily in the fertile realms of the western and southern regions, the allure of onions transcends geographical boundaries, gracing dining tables year-round. However, this culinary cornerstone faces a daunting challenge: the entrenched inefficiencies within the onion value chain, compounded by the vegetable's inherent perishability, lead to substantial losses during storage. The reliance on traditional open ventilated storage structures, a deeply ingrained practice in agriculture, sheds light on its limitations, with reported losses ranging from 40% to 60%, highlighting the urgent need for innovative solutions. Despite commendable government initiatives investing in expansive open storage facilities to stabilize market prices, the persistent specter of post-harvest losses remains a formidable obstacle. India's status as the world's second-largest producer of onions, yielding approximately 25 million metric tons in 2021, stands in stark contrast to the sobering reality that 40% of fruits and vegetables, including the cherished onion, succumb to spoilage before reaching consumers. Additionally, India's pivotal role as a major exporter of onions, particularly to discerning markets like the United Arab Emirates, underscores the imperative for streamlined and efficient storage practices. Offering a beacon of hope, research unveils a promising avenue: onions, when meticulously stored within the temperature range of 30°F to 50°F, exhibit the remarkable capacity to preserve their freshness for up to one year. It is within this realm of potential that this thesis emerges, presenting an innovative and technologically-driven solution to confront the onion storage challenge head-on. Advocating for a paradigm shift, this thesis champions the integration of cutting-edge technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things), Machine Learning, and web-based systems to revolutionize onion storage practices. Envisioned as a system tailored for real-time monitoring and precise control of storage conditions, this solution holds the promise of significantly extending the shelf life of onions. Beyond enhancing storage efficiency, this solution aligns with global efforts for food security and reduced agricultural wastage. Thus, this thesis charts a course toward a sustainable future for onion storage, resonating with a nation's aspirations to nourish its people while safeguarding agricultural abundance.
